This is a fork of [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) that changes its [transform](https://docs.jsonata.org/other-operators#-------transform) functionality to perform a [deep merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) instead of a shallow one.  It also adds a $deepmerge function that mirrors [$merge](https://docs.jsonata.org/object-functions.html#merge).
